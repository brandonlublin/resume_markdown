### Stem
##### In the age of the Cell Phone, it's rare that you add contacts directly to your computer. But with cross-device data transfer, why does your computer need to be left in the dust? Here is where Stem comes in. Stem is a great way to store - not only your personal phone contacts - but links to social media profiles as well, in one centralized location.

### WeatherSpot 
##### When I wake up in the morning; living in soggy Seattle, the first thing I do is check the weather to find out how hard it’s raining. Along with my teammates, we determined the easiest way to mitigate the winter-rain sadness was to add a fitting playlist to turn our moods around! Enter WeatherSpot

### FriendFinder
##### Scenario: You run into an old acquaintance at a coffee shop. They ask if they can sit down next to you but there's one problem: You can't remember how you know this person... Here is where FriendFinder comes in handy. Bust out a quick ten question survey and it won't be too difficult to tell whether or not you want this person at your workstation.
